        In a leadership role at ITV - the largest commercial broadcaster in the
        UK - I led the transformation of ITV Online to Agile. In combination
        with other changes, ITV Online moved from a £13million loss in 2012
        to profit-making in 2012. The success of the ITV Online agile approach
        led other technology divisions to adopt and use agile with my and others
        support.
